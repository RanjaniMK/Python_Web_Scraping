Procedure for creating Package/Library:

1. Find 'site package' folder in python installation folder. 
   On my system, the path to the folder is:
   C:\Users\Ranjani\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\Lib\site-packages

   The following could be of help:
   import sys
   print(sys.path)

2.Create a folder here by name: 'automation' (Library/Package)

3.Create _init_.py file inside automation folder.

4.Create a module  automate.py inside automation folder.

5. Write all the required functions for this project inside automate.py

6. Later on create a python file with a name of your choice, and from inside this file you could call functions from    automation library, i.e. you can import modules from this automation library:
 Example: from automation import automate
